#randimg

randimg is a program that takes a folder and chooses a random image from it.
Currently, there is only a GUI version available, but a CLI could be easily made.

PyQt4 is required to run the GUI.

##Prerequisites

You will need Python version 3 and PyQt4.

##Install

First, clone the git repository

    git clone https://github.com/lh2/randimg.git

Change into the projects directory

    cd randimg

Run the setup script

    python setup.py install

Done! Now you should be able to execute `randimg-qt`.
